## What next?

If you have time, why not add some more features to your application to improve the User Experience (UX)?


#### You could:

+ **Add visual feedback:** animate sprites while the playlist is compiling or show when it is done
+ **Make a ‘shuffle’ button:** add a new sprite that plays back your `Playlist`{:class="block3variables"} at `random`{:class="block3operators"}
+ **Play the samples for less time:** add a script that uses broadcasts to stop the playback after a set amount of time using the `stop`{:class="block3flag"} block in the `Spotify`{:class="block3flag"} menu

The final stage of this quest is for you to package up all your projects ready to share them with us, and answer some questions about your project. 

It won’t take long, and your ML application will be seen by people working in the field of artificial intelligence who are excited to give you their expert feedback on your amazing app!
