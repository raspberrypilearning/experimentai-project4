## Introduction

Now you have trained your ML model, you need to test that it returns songs like the ones you specified. 

In this stage, you will create the Scratch application that will use your trained model to create a list of songs for each of your classes.

**Your project will:**
+ Search for songs on the music database in a genre you specify
+ Compare the songs returned against the chosen class in your trained model
+ Reject songs which match your reject class definition
+ Reject songs which don’t match your chosen class definition
+ Provide audio feedback to the user that a rejection has taken place
+ Compile song titles which match your chosen class definition to generate a ‘playlist’


**Your project should:**
+ Play back songs in your generated playlist
+ Use similar sprites to your classification application
+ Provide visual and audio feedback while compiling a playlist


**Your project could:**
+ Play back songs in your generated playlist in ‘shuffle mode’
