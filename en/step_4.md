## Search for songs

<p style='border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;'>
The next part of your script will use the playlist length your user requests, to search for music that fits your class. It will keep searching until it finds the number of songs on the database which fit your userâ€™s requested playlist.
</p>

Logically, you want the app to keep on searching for songs that fit, until the playlist is the length requested by the user.

Add a `repeat until < >`{:class="block3control"} block from the golden `Control`{:class="block3control"} menu to your script:

--- /task ---

--- task ---

From the green `Operators`{:class="block3operators"} menu, place a gem-shaped `( ) = (50`{:class="block3operators"}) block into the gem shaped hole in the repeat until block:

```blocks3

```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

From the orange List menu, add a `length of [Playlist]`{:class="block3variables"} block into the first hole of the green operator block:

```blocks3

```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

From the orange `Variables`{:class="block3variables"} menu, add a length bubble to the second hole of the green operator block:

```blocks3

```

This will make a loop that repeats until the Playlist is the length your user defined earlier.

The next thing you need your application to do is search for a random song on the music database to compare to your model.

Add a `random song from genre( )`{:class="block3flag"} block from the green `Spotify`{:class="block3flag"} menu to your new loop:

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add an orange genre bubble from the orange `Variables`{:class="block3variables"} menu to the green `random song`{:class="block3flag"} block:

--- /task ---
